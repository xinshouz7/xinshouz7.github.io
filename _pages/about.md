[TRSVR: An Adaptive Stochastic Trust-Region Method with Variance Reduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14647)

**Xinshou Zheng**\*, Yuchen Fang\*, Javad Lavaei

- A stochastic trust-region method for unconstrained nonconvex optimization that incorporates stochastic variance-reduced gradients (SVRG) to accelerate convergence.
